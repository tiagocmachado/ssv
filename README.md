## Introduction

Secret Shared Validator ('SSV') is a unique technology that enables the distributed control and operation of an Ethereum validator.

SSV uses an MPC threshold scheme with a consensus layer on top ([Istanbul BFT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.03613.pdf)), 
that governs the network. \
Its core strength is in its robustness and fault tolerance which leads the way for an open network of staking operators 
to run validators in a decentralized and trustless way.
